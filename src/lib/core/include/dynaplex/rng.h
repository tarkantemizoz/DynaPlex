		/**
		 * Initiates the random number generator, based on provided parameters: Eval, global_seed, sample, trajectory, stream.
		 *
		 * This function combines the values of sample, trajectory, and stream to generate a unique seed,
		 * and then XORs this combined value with the global_seed. The generated seed is used for generating an RNG for training purposes,
		 * ensuring variability and reproducibility based on the input parameters.
		 *
		 * Parameters:
		 * - eval (bool): Indicates whether the rng will be used for training or evaluation purposes. Seeds used for training purposes are non-overlapping with
		 * those used for evaluation purposes.
		 * - global_seed (int64_t): A global seed value used to introduce additional variability. Must be a non-negative value
		 *   (most significant bit must be 0).
		 * - sample (int64_t): A value representing the sample. Must be non-negative and less than 2^30.
		 * - trajectory (int64_t): A value representing the trajectory. Must be non-negative and less than 2^23.
		 * - stream (int64_t): A value representing the stream. Must be non-negative and less than 2^10.
			 *
		 * Throws if any of these requirements are not met.
		 *
		 * The function first combines the sample, trajectory, and stream values by left-shifting and OR-ing them, ensuring that these values
		 * are placed in separate bit ranges of a 64-bit integer. Finally, the function XORs the combined value with
		 * the global_seed to produce the final training seed, which is used to seed the generator.
		 *
		 * Return:
		 * - DynaPlex::RNG based on the generated training seed.
